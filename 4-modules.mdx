# What is it?
<ul>
<Appear>
    <li>CSS run through JS</li>
    <li>Adds local scoping to CSS</li>
    <li>Allows you to compose classes into other classes</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
- Requires webpack or a build step to process the CSS
- Scopes all CSS you write locally to where it was imported
- Supported by create react apps 2+ by default
</Notes>

### What you wrote in styles.css

.<span style={{color: 'orchid'}}>title</span>

---

### What you get when you build

.<span style={{color: 'mediumaquamarine'}}>_styles__</span><span style={{color: 'orchid'}}>title</span><span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>_309571057</span>

<Notes>
- You'll note it's almost like an automatic BEM
- Classes that aren't used get dropped

- Local scope!! Don't think about names or conflicts anymore
- Dependencies are clear and classes are composable from within existing files and external files
