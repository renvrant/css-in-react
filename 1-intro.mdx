# <span style={{color: 'orchid'}}>CSS in React</span>

<Notes>Intro to me, intro to topic
- 4 Techniques
- All of them come from the same point
</Notes>

# CSS <span style={{color: 'red'}}>Pain</span>

<ul>
<Appear>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Maintainability</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
Techniques are often derived from pain, they become the problems we need to solve
- Visual consistency: Making sure things look the same everywhere
- Performance: Keeping load times fast and snappy
- Maintainability: How we grow and change our CSS over time

Maintainability has huge effects on the other two

# Maintainability Problems

<ul>
<Appear>
    <li>Styles are easy to add, hard to remove</li>
    <li>Global scope is flexible, but enforces nothing</li>
    <li>Specificity overrides are easy to add, hard to remove</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

<Notes>
- Hard to remove CSS because without visual regression testing it's hard to tell what's still there
- This is compounded by conditional styles; automated checkers can tell you what isn't used but not what will never BE used
- CSS is globally applied, which compounds the above problem; a change anywhere can break something anywhere else
- You wind up relying on good naming more than you ought to
